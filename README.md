## Missions objectives

At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:

* *JavaScript* skills
* Incremental skills
* Cookie skills


## The mission

This challenge will have you create a {clicker}[cookie clicker].
Follow the instructions to complete the challenge, to get some ideas check the
examples in the _resources_ section.



### Instructions

NOTE: The steps below are meant to help you in development, but as long as you
make a cookie clicker you can implement whatever you want.

Step 1: base structure
Write the base structure for the project in *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*.
Within the HTML, put a _click_ button which will increment a counter and a label
initialised at _0_ to display said counter. 

Step 2: prepare the JavaScript
In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and
label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.

Step 3: increase the score
When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by _1_, then
display the current score inside the label.

Step 4: make a multiplier
Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will
permanently multiply the number of points per click, by _two_ for example.

Step 5: price of multiplier
The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn't be free,
it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

Step 6: no credit
You can't make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score.
Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

Step 7: display multiplier counter
Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth
_5_, then the button should display something like _multiplier x5_.

Step 8: increase the cost
Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each
time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

Step 9: display the cost
In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the
upgrade.

Step 10: auto-clicker
Implement a new improvement to buy, the _auto-click_. As the name might suggest
this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each _x_ seconds.

Step 11: bonus
Implement yet another improvement to buy, the _bonus_. It should grant the
player a boost in score of _200%_ per click for _30 seconds_. When purchased the
player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.

Step 12: deactivate the buttons
Make it so that, if the player doesn't have the points to purchase a multiplier,
an auto-click or an other bonus, he can't.

Step 13: make it pretty
Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra
JavaScript.

### What did I learn from this exercise?

1. Setting up my variables in a logical fashion
2. How to use setInterval 
3. To implement multiple statements inside a function to specify specific results
4. Folder structure 
5. Learn by teaching is very effective and can help understanding things I didn't at first

### Issues I came across on this exercise

1. Adjusting the tracking of the cost and levels in buttons
   * Added ID's to the html for these and linked them in js to update accordingly


2. Mathematical issues 
    * Trial and error, but due to dropping the issues and tracking back to it after a while figured it out due to getting my head clear


3. Milestones not working or working incorrectly
   * Mathematical issues fixed
   * Found mistakes in code, due to telling myself what does this line/function do and figuring out the mistakes


4. Taking a break, to get a quick drink f.e., just to clear your head and get focus back on
